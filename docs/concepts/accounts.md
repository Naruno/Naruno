# The Accounts

The most important area of the Naruno Blockchain is Accounts. It makes the **Blockchain light**.

The core elements of an [account](https://github.com/Naruno/Naruno/blob/master/decentra_network/accounts/account.py#L19) are:

- An identifying **address**, such as 6e427f9c0e6ee1d71ea7516d5ae861da5dc9cc11. (This naruno **specific [addressing](#addressing-system)**.)
- A **sequence number**, which helps make sure any transactions this account sends are applied in the correct order and only once each. After a transaction, the sender account's sequence number increases by 1.
- An **DNC balance**. Some of this DNC is set aside for the [Reserve](#reserve).

    Accounts : +string address
    Accounts : +integer sequence_number
    Accounts : +float balance
    Accounts : +get_hash(amount)
    Accounts : +dump_json(amount)
    Accounts : +load_json(amount)

```

# Address Function

Addresses allow accounts to take up less space.
The diagram below shows how the decentra network address is created from the public key.

```mermaid

    subgraph Address
        direction LR

        PublicKey[PublicKey]
        sha256[sha256]
        last40[Last 40 characters]


        PublicKey --> sha256 -- 2x --- sha256 --o last40


    end

```

Public key is generated by ECDSA algorithm.

This function gives the address of a public key.
You can import with this command

```python
from decentra_network.wallet.wallet import Address

public_key = "MFYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEAAoDQgAEAtLa9K8MLg+frIEFBYmbYDsc0INqXedAF8SlpEGQQmOSjKV+6MxpVP53bl6elalJfCMV33WhqAelf3qkx+QHvw=="

print(Address(public_key)
```

# Reserve

Each account takes up some space in the Naruno network, so an account needs to be valuable to take up space. Reserve amount is therefore required.

- The reserve amount is currently 1000 DNC. ([Pull Request #65](https://github.com/Naruno/Naruno/commit/dead29d08e96fea738911b1cd90fe7d2d0a62c44#diff-17332442b68875a6b66bd4989c8ed80c22ce1c836445aa7042145b0c0627cf30R64))

### Changing the Reserve Amount

The reserve amount can be changed if the community accepts it in direct proportion to the price of the DNC coin.
