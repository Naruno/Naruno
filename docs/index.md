# Introduction
From the beginning of internet, all systems are designed as an client or server. With this the data security, authority and our futures are in the hands of a few.

From 2008 to today, the world has seen the rise of cryptocurrencies. These cryptocurrencies are the first step to a decentralized world. But they are not enough. We need a decentralized network that can be used by everyone. 

This network should be realistic, stable and functional because futures are based on the present. So this network must be able to be used by everyone, everywhere and for everything.

This network is Decentra Network.
